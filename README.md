    <h1>ClipMod</h1>
</div>
ClipMod is a modding API for the game Universal Paperclips.
<h2>Installation</h2>
Go to Playing if you don't intend on making mods yourself, or Modding if you do.
<h3>Playing</h3>
We've included a shell script (<code>apply.sh</code>) to auto-download the page and apply the patches so that you can play ClipMod.
<h4>Loading mods via URLs</h4>
To load a mod via a URL to the <b>raw JS code</b>, you can use the GUI added in the mod. Copy and paste the URL to the raw code file, and then click "Add Mod & Reload". To remove the mod, choose it from the dropdown and click "Disable Mod & Reload".
<h3>Modding</h3>
Your best resources will be the <code>exampleMod.js</code> file as well as the <a href="https://github.com/mechanikate/clipmod/wiki">wiki</a>.
